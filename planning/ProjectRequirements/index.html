<h1 id="project-requirements">Project Requirements</h1>
<p><strong>Contributors:</strong> Ayo, Alisha, Andrews, Will, Kyle, Natasha</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Friday, September 24, 2021</p>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>The CMPUT 401 project portal will solve the problem of CMPUT 401 students not easily being able to showcase their CMPUT 401 projects to potential employers or to prove that they worked on their CMPUT 401 projects. It will also solve the problem of connecting Albertan nonprofits and early stage startups that have interesting project ideas with teams of CMPUT 401 students who can help implement those ideas. Additionally, the project portal will solve the problem of CMPUT 401 instructors not easily being able to find enough projects for CMPUT 401 students to work on. The project portal's users will be Albertan nonprofits and early stage startups; students; and employers or any other people that are interested in viewing the projects on the portal. The value proposition / essential functionality of the project portal is to connect Albertan nonprofits and early stage startups with teams of students who can help make the nonprofits' and startups' interesting ideas a reality.</p>

<h2 id="similar-products">Similar Products</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/notion-2-0">ProductHunt</a>
    - Platform to share and discover new products
    - Design: Demo Page
        - We could use ProductHunt's demo page as inspiration for designing Project Portal's demo pages (so, demo videos would be near the top of the page and user comments would be under the demo videos)
    - Functionality: Upvote Button
        - ProductHunt only has an upvote button for projects (so, no dislike button), and we could implement a similar feature in Project Portals to maintain a positive environment for project contributors.</li>
<li><a href="https://betalist.com/">BetaList</a>
    - Community for makers and early adopters to showcase their startups
    - Design: Home Page
        - We could use BetaList's home page as inspiration for designing Project Portal's home page (so, we'd have a gallery view to showcase projects and their descriptions instead of, or in addition to, a list view)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.launchingnext.com/">Launching Next</a>
    - Platform to publish the newest, trending tech startups and projects.
    - Design: Browse Page
        - Launching Next's startups are organized by tags to browse through, which we could as inspiration for how we organize projects
    - Functionality: External Link to Startup
        - Launching Next's startups have external links to their webpage, so users can go to a startup's webpage directly from the startup's Launching Next webpage. We could implement a similar feature so that project portal pages link to the project webpages/apps.
    - Functionality: Share Link
        - Startups that have a page on Launching Next have the ability to share a link to their Launching Next page. We could implement a similar feature so that clients and students could share links to their projects on the portal.</li>
<li><a href="https://angel.co/">AngelList</a>
    - Platform for investors to find startups to invest in and for people who want to work at startups to find a job.
    - Design: Candidate Profiles
        - AngelList candidates can create profiles with their job title and experiences; we could use that profile design as inspiration for what information students could fill into their project portal student profile.
    - Design: Company Profiles
        - AngelList companies and startups can make profiles with a summary, previous/current jobs, who works there, pictures and descriptions of work culture, etc.; we could use that profile design as inspiration for what information clients could fill into their project portal client profile.
    - Functionality: Job Posting
        - AngelList clients have the ability to post a job and to look for people to join their startup. We could implement a similar feature where project portal clients would be able to propose projects for students to work on directly on the project portal.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="open-source-products">Open-source Products</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/SAP/project-portal-for-innersource">Project Portal for InnerSource</a>
    - Platform for people to find InnerSource projects.
    - Design: Home Page
        - We could use BetaList's home page as inspiration for designing Project Portal's home page (so, we'd have a gallery view to showcase projects, their project screenshots/images, and their descriptions)</li>
<li><a href="https://react-hook-form.com/">React Hook Form</a>
    - Tool for easing the form-building process in React.
    - Functionality: Tool
        - We could use React Hook Form with all the forms that we create within the project portal to make it easier for us to manage form inputs, form submission and more.</li>
